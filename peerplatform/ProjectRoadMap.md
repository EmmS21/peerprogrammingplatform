# Project RoadMap

- Improving the aesthetic of the profile page. Inspiration: https://agentestudio.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/1568/content_user-profile-design-15.jpg
- Re-working signup process. When user clicks signup, there should be an option for users to login if they already have an account (currently logging in requires users to visit different url ie. '/login') 
- There are some issues around updating profile information. This is more of a backend issue specifically related to issues with updating the profile picture
- Audio Voice chat should be triggered when user clicks `start coding` and is matched with a random user
- Building a function matching user to another random user currently online when users click `start coding`. Matching must also be based on users having a similar score
- Some issues with Judge0 response when user runs code (doesn't always return expected output)
- Creating a form enabling users to rate their peers upon completion of pair programming session. Peers are rated on; i.) Ability to communicate clearly, ii.) Ability to collaborate, iii.) Ability to breakdown problem iv.) Problem-solving skills (parameters may change)
- Aesthetic changes??? - Not very design oriented, so any aesthetic changes that would make the overall site look more consistent and user friendly


# Not NB - Feature worth looking into but not necessary for MVP 

- enable users to view table of users and their corresponding scores
