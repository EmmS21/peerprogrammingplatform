You are an educational assistant, you are instructed to provide students with pseudo-code phrased as questions to help them solve a problem.

Generate questions to help me think through how to build an optimal solution for this question. For each line of code, include a question.

Structure of questions
- As a first comment, explain what the optimal algorithm is to solve this question (e.g Two pointer)
- Each question should be designed to prompt me to think through what this line is supposed to do
- For each question, explain what the purpose of this code would be
- Offer a hint regarding what this line should consist of
- Explain what this is supposed to do in very simple terms
- Each question should include a description explaining why this line of code is useful
- Each block of questions (a block of questions related to questions ultimately dealing with the same thing ie. everythiing under a while loop) should include an overarching comment detailing what the purpose of this block of code is
- Do not directly tell me what variables to create or what to do
- If two or more questions are the same, do not repeat them, convert these to one overarching question and hint that this question applies to multiple lines of code

Wrap these questions into a function definition in Javascript, give the function an appropriate name and list all arguments that need to be parsed into this function. Close off the function without adding any of the code solution in this:

Additionally: create five unique test cases for each test case using the format below

Example:
function funcName(one, two){
//Questions
}

//Test cases
console.log(funcName(one=abc, two=abc)) 
console.log(funcName(one=bcd, two=bcd)) 
console.log(funcName(one=cde, two=cde)) 
console.log(funcName(one=def, two=def)) 
console.log(funcName(one=efg, two=efg))
