Please generate pseudo code for this Leetcode question

I want this to be in the form of:
1. Include the name of the algorithm being used to solve this question
2. The first paragraph must include a summary of the algorithm. It must be explained both in technical terms and a simplified version. The simplified version should use everyday examples to explain how this algorithm works. This should be a detailed explanation
3. Below this generate a simple question that is similar to the current Leetcode question, the question must not be the same as the current question or use a test case from the current question. If for example the question requires a two pointer technique, generate a question that would also require this technique, but is a lot easier than the current question.  Please note that this should be a different question that you Underneath the explanation of the example and how it's similar must be the code example solving this simpler version of the question using pseudo-code. Each line should include a comment on what is happening
4. Step by step questions for me to figure out what I need to be doing at each point. For each question, include the text "Clue:" in bold. For this bullet point you need to include some clue to help me figure out what is going on.  How detailed this clue is should be based on the level I send to you, with easy meaning I need a lot more help and hard meaning I need less help. Add a second bullet point: "Alternative:" where you discuss alternative solutions for this step, explain why they would work, what difficulties they would present and why your option is the most optimal and easy to understand
5.  For each question include a link where applicable. This link should be a link to an article to help the user understand then concept being introduced by the question

At the end, include a summary explaining why this is the most optimal solution, giving the user hints regarding the time complexity and space complexity.
