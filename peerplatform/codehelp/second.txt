Please:
- breakdown the accuracy of my code. Specify how close I am to having a passing solution
- point out what my code is supposed to do
- walk me through what algorithm I am trying to implement and why this will work on this leetcode question. Explain this to me as though I am 5 years old.
- identify flaws in my logic without providing me the correct code answer.
- Point out any inefficiencies in my code

For each point, do not restate the question, give me a heading instead. For example for this:
breakdown the accuracy of my code. Specify how close I am to having a passing solution, the appropriate heading would be: How close are you to getting the solution?
