Convert the solution you generated into pseudo-logic. Do not return the solution itself (do not return any code!)

Structure of pseudo-logic
- each point should explain what the code is expected to do
- each point should be phrased as a question
- each point should include a description explaining why this line of code is useful
- each block of pseudo-logic (a block of pseudo-logic is logic ultimately dealing with the same thing ie. everythiing under a while loop) should include an overarching comment detailing what the purpose of this block of code is

What you should return
- Include the function definition and wrap all the pseudo logic under their relevant functions
- Include return statements
- Include atleast 4 test cases and expected output
- Aside from the above 3, do not return any code

Structure of Output:
function functionName(one, two){
    //pseudo-logic
    //pseudo-logic
    //pseudo-logic
    return
}
//test cases
